# Performance tests demonstration

Hi!

This is a demonstration of how to implement stress testing for a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) server using [Artillery](https://www.artillery.io/), all running within [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers.

## How to run this demo

### Prerequisites

1. Docker installed on your machine.

### Steps

1. **Build the images**:

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start the containers**:

   ```sh
   npm run start
   ```

   **Note:** You can observe the containers stats running

   ```sh
   npm run stats
   ```

3. **Check the results at `performance_tests/reports`**:

4. **Stop the containers**:
   ```sh
   npm run stop
   ```

## Guide

Below is a guide on the steps you have to take to implement on your own project

### Steps

1. **Prepare Your Node.js Server**:

   - Ensure your Node.js server is Dockerized and running within a container.

2. **Prepare Artillery Configuration**:

   - Create an Artillery configuration file (like `artillery.yml`) in your project directory. Define your load testing scenarios, including the target endpoint and desired load.

3. **Build Docker Image for Artillery**:

   - Create a Dockerfile to build a custom Docker image for Artillery, or utilize the existing Artillery Docker image from the Docker Hub.

4. **Run Artillery in Docker Container**:

   - Use the built Artillery Docker image to run your load test by mounting the current directory containing your Artillery configuration file into the container.

5. **Analyze Results**:
   - After the load test completes, analyze the results generated by Artillery to assess the performance and scalability of your Node.js server.
